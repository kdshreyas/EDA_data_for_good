# datathon_data_for_good

In this datathon competition, you will analyze real Twitter data from almost 100 non-profits in the Waterloo Region to answer questions such as which posts make the maximum impact, whether the sentiment of the post has an impact on engagement, which keywords most captivate Twitter followers.

This analysis is valuable to non-profits who need to keep their followers, volunteers and donors engaged with their organization to ensure they can keep supporting our community. We will be inviting select non-profits to attend the results presentations, with many interested in a summary of the key insights!
